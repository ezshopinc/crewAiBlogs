And, while the toys our children play with today may seem vastly different from the toys we played with as children, the truth is that the basic concepts and ideas behind many of the toys we grew up with have remained the same.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/wooden-toys/vehicles/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">wooden toy cars</a> that a child in the early 1900s played with are not all that different from the wooden cars that children today still love to play with. The same can be said for <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/wooden-toys/building-sets/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">building toys</a> and <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/wooden-toys/pretend-play/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">imaginative play toys</a>, which have remained relatively unchanged for decades.</p><p><br></p><p>Each era has been marked by its own unique toy innovations and advancements, as well as enduring materials and designs that have made them a classic. In this guide, we’ll take a journey through the past, present, and future of toys and discuss the enduring appeal of classic toys.</p><p><br></p><h2 class="ql-align-center">The Timeless Appeal of Classic Toys</h2><p>There’s a reason that classic toys have been able to stand the test of time. The enduring appeal of classic toys can be attributed to their high-quality, nostalgic design, and their ability to promote skill-building and imagination. Here are a few of the ways that classic toys have continued to capture the hearts of children and parents for generations:</p><p><br></p><h3>The Allure of Tin Soldiers and Wind-Up Toys</h3><p>The early 1900s was the golden age of tin toys. Tin toys were popular for their durability and affordability. They were also the first toys to be mass-produced, making them more accessible to children. Tin toys came in all shapes and sizes, from <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/retro/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">classic cars</a> to animals to robots, and were often brightly painted in eye-catching colors.</p><p><br></p><p>Another classic toy from this era is the wind-up toy. The first wind-up toys were made from metal and were initially sold as novelty items for adults. However, it didn’t take long for the appeal of wind-up toys to capture the hearts of children. Wind-up toys are powered by a simple clockwork motor that is wound up by hand. Once wound up, the toy will move and walk on its own.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The skill and precision required to make these toys move with just a spring made them a marvel of engineering and a beloved toy for children in the early 1900s. The joy that these toys brought to children is perfectly captured in the classic Christmas tale, “The Steadfast Tin Soldier,” by Hans Christian Andersen.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Magic of Wooden Trains and Blocks</h3><p>It’s no secret that we love <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/wooden-toys/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">wooden toys</a> at The Tot. Our collection of heirloom-quality wooden toys includes everything from trains to building blocks to balance bikes. Wooden toys have been a staple in the world of toys for centuries and were one of the first materials used to make toys.</p><p><br></p><p>The late 1800s and early 1900s were a time of great innovation and change. The industrial revolution brought about advancements in manufacturing and technology, which made new materials and toys more accessible than ever before. This era saw a wide variety of toys made from tin, lead, and even early plastics like Bakelite. However, for many children, especially those from lower-income families, wood was the most accessible and affordable material to make toys from.</p><p><br></p><p>Wooden toys from this era included simple toys like blocks and trains. The first <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/wooden-toys/vehicles/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">wooden trains</a> were introduced in the early 1910s by a German company called Brio. The iconic wooden train track and magnetic coupling system that Brio pioneered has made wooden train sets a timeless classic that is still beloved by children today.</p><p><br></p><p>Building blocks are another classic wooden toy that has been loved by children for generations. The first patent for a “Lego”-like interlocking block was filed in 1913 by a company called The Kiddicraft Company. While The Kiddicraft Company’s blocks were never mass-produced, they laid the foundation for the modern LEGO blocks that were patented in 1958 and have since become one of the most popular and enduring toys in the world.</p><p><br></p><h2 class="ql-align-center">Mid-Century Marvels: Toys from the 1950s and 1960s</h2><p>The 1950s and 1960s were a time of great change and innovation. The end of World War II ushered in a new era of prosperity and consumerism. The 1950s and 60s saw the rise of the baby boomer generation, which meant that there were more children in American households than ever before. This era also saw great advancements in technology and manufacturing, which meant that toys could be produced more affordably than ever before.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Rise of Plush and Stuffed Animals</h3><p>The 1950s saw the rise of the plush and stuffed animal industry. While stuffed animals have been loved by children for centuries, it wasn’t until the 1950s that stuffed animals began to be mass-produced. The invention of new materials and sewing techniques made it possible to produce stuffed animals more affordably than ever before. This meant that stuffed animals were no longer a luxury item reserved for the wealthy, and could now be enjoyed by children from all walks of life.</p><p><br></p><p>The 1950s and 60s saw the introduction of iconic stuffed animals and plush toys like <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/stuffed-animals/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Teddy bears</a>, which were first introduced in the early 1900s and have remained a classic ever since. Other popular plush toys from this era include <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/stuffed-animals/plush-dolls/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">rag dolls, bunnies, dogs, cats, and farm animals</a>. The timeless appeal of plush toys makes them a great toy to collect and pass down from generation to generation.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Pioneering Era of Plastic Toys</h3><p>The 1950s and 60s saw the rise of the plastic toy industry. For the first time, toys could be made from a new material called plastic. Plastic toys were more affordable to produce than metal or wood toys, which meant that they could be sold at a lower price point. This made plastic toys more accessible to children than ever before.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the first plastic toys to be mass-produced was the <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/retro/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Lego brick</a>. The Lego Group was founded in 1932, but it wasn’t until the late 1950s that they began producing the interlocking plastic bricks that they are known for today. The first Lego brick was patented in 1958, and the rest, as they say, is history. Lego bricks have since become one of the most popular and enduring toys in the world. What sets Lego apart from other toys is its ability to grow with the child, making it a timeless toy that can be enjoyed for a lifetime and passed down through generations.</p><p><br></p><h2 class="ql-align-center">Retro Delights: Toys from the 1970s and 1980s</h2><p>The 1970s and 1980s were a time of great innovation and change in the world of toys. The 1970s saw the end of the Vietnam War and the energy crisis, which meant that there was a renewed sense of optimism and creativity in America. The 1980s saw the rise of the personal computer, which meant that children now had access to video games and digital toys.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Golden Age of Action Figures</h3><p>The 1970s saw the rise of action figures. Action figures are posable figures that are often sold with accessories and are designed to be played with.

Joe</a>, which was introduced by Hasbro in 1964. G.I. Joe was a 12-inch posable action figure that was sold with a variety of different outfits and accessories. G.I. Joe was initially marketed as an “action soldier” and was designed to appeal to boys who were interested in military and adventure play.</p><p><br></p><p>The success of G.I. Joe paved the way for other popular action figure lines like <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/action-figures/star-wars/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Star Wars</a> and <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/action-figures/marvel/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Marvel</a> action figures. The 1970s and 80s saw the introduction of iconic action figures like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and Indiana Jones. Action figures quickly became one of the most popular toys among boys and remain a beloved toy to this day.</p><p><br></p><h3>The Boom of Electronic and Battery-Operated Toys</h3><p>The 1980s saw the rise of electronic and battery-operated toys. The invention of the personal computer and the microchip meant that it was now possible to make toys that were electronic and interactive. This era saw the introduction of iconic electronic toys like <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/electronic-toys/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Tamagotchi</a>, <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/electronic-toys/handheld-games/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">handheld electronic games</a>, and <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/electronic-toys/robots/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">robots</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Tamagotchi were first introduced in Japan in 1996 and quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. Tamagotchi are handheld digital pets that are designed to be cared for and nurtured. The goal of the game is to keep your Tamagotchi alive for as long as possible by feeding it, playing with it, and cleaning up after it. Tamagotchi are a great example of a toy that was designed to teach children responsibility and nurturing skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Handheld electronic games were also popular in the 1980s. Handheld games were simple electronic games that were played on a small handheld device. The most popular handheld game of the 1980s was <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/electronic-toys/handheld-games/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Nintendo’s Game & Watch</a>, which was the precursor to the iconic Game Boy.</p><p><br></p><h2 class="ql-align-center">Modern Classics: Toys from the 1990s to Now</h2><p>The 1990s to today have seen a massive shift in the types of toys that children play with. The 1990s saw the rise of digital and electronic toys, including video games, which forever changed the way that children play. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement towards more traditional toys, with parents and toymakers alike recognizing the importance of skill-building and imagination in early childhood development.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>The Influence of Video Games and Digital Play</h3><p>The 1990s saw the rise of video games. The invention of the personal computer in the 1980s meant that it was now possible to make more advanced video games. The 1990s saw the introduction of iconic video game consoles like the <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/video-games/nintendo/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Nintendo 64</a>, the <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/video-games/playstation/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">PlayStation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.thetot.com/en/toys/video-games/game-boy/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Game Boy</a>.
